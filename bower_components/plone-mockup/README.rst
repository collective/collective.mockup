This project (Plone Mockup) is an atempt to to modernize Plone's javascript story.

Check out examples and documentation at http://plone.github.io/mockup/

Alternatively, clone this repo and checkout the *getting started* section of the **index.html**,
which will be much more up-to-date than the website.

The primary goals of this project are to:

1. Standardize configuration of patterns implemented in js
   to use HTML data attributes, so they can be developed and
   without running a backend server.
2. Use modern AMD approach to declaring dependencies on other js libs.
3. Full unit testing of js

Here's a list of the javascripts included in Plone and the current
status of converting them to the Mockup approach: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiJ1qTbr6NdMdDMzNVVqZ1ZIOGFZWHZDV1BPWnM4OEE#gid=0
